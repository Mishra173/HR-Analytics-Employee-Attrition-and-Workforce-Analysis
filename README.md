##  Project Workflow

###  1. Data Cleaning & Processing (Python)
- Loaded dataset using Pandas
- Handled missing values
- Created derived columns (Age Group, Experience Group)

- Performed aggregation queries:
  - Attrition by Department
  - Attrition by Salary Slab
  - Attrition by Overtime
  - Attrition by Experience Level
- Generated SQL-based insights and business recommendations

 ### 3. Dashboard Development (Power BI)
- Connected Power BI to MySQL database
- Created DAX measures:
  - Total Employees
  - Total Attrition
  - Attrition Rate %
- Designed interactive HR dashboard
- Added slicers for dynamic analysis
- Generated business insights
