##  Project Workflow

###  1. Data Cleaning & Processing (Python)
- Loaded dataset using Pandas
- Checked for missing values and validated data quality
- Created derived columns (Age Group, Experience Group)
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis using Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Identified initial attrition patterns
- Prepared structured dataset for database storage

### 2.SQL Analysis (MySQL)
- Created MySQL database (hranalytic)
- Imported cleaned dataset using SQLAlchemy
- Performed SQL-based aggregation analysis including:
- Workforce summary metrics
- Department-wise attrition
- Salary slab impact
- Overtime impact
- Job satisfaction analysis
- Experience group analysis
- Age & gender attrition comparison
- Generated SQL-based insights and business recommendations

 ### 3. Dashboard Development (Power BI)
- Connected Power BI to MySQL database
- Created DAX measures:
  - Total Employees
  - Total Attrition
  - Attrition Rate %
- Designed interactive HR Analytics dashboard
- Added slicers for dynamic analysis
- Generated business insights



 ##  Key Business Insights

- Employees working overtime show higher attrition.
- Low salary slab has the highest attrition rate.
- Attrition decreases as job satisfaction increases.
- Employees with lower experience are more likely to leave.


 ## Business Recommendations

- Reduce excessive overtime through workload redistribution.
- Review compensation structure for lower salary slabs.
- Improve employee engagement and job satisfaction initiatives.
